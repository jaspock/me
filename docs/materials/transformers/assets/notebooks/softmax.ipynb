As the softmax regressor expects a single vector (or a batch of vectors) as input, we will transform every sentence into an embedding vector. You probably don't know how to perform this transformation yet, so for now we will rely on a library that performs the task for us. \n",

Each model has specific features such as number of parameters, size of the resulting embeddings, supported languages, etc. The particular model is not relevant for our objectives here, so let's use one of the smallest (and fastest) called [gte-small](https://huggingface.co/thenlper/gte-small).

In natural language processing we will measure this similarity with metrics such as the *cosine similarity* or a less compute-intensive alternative such as the *dot product* (also called scalar product). We could do `print(embeddings[0])` to print the whole tensor, but it would print a lot of values (actually, 384), so let's print the first 3 values as a subtensor so that you can see that sentences have been transformed into a bunch of numbers. Don't worry too much about the particular values of the cosine similarity (they are values between -1 and 1); just focus on the fact that similar sentences will have closer embeddings and cosine similarities closer to 1.\n",

        "To define our model with PyTorch we write a class that inherits from `torch.nn.Module`. We define the layers and parameters of the model in the constructor (`__init__`) and the forward pass in the `forward` method. The forward pass is the method that will be called to obtain the output of a model given an input. In our case, the input will be a mini-batch of sentence embeddings and the output will be a vector of logits of size 3 (one value for each topic). The softmax function will then be applied to the output vector to obtain a probability distribution over the 3 topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the code, we define a class `SoftmaxRegressor` which extends `torch.nn.Module`, the fundamental building block for neural networks in PyTorch. The `__init__` method has two parameters: `input_size` (size of the input features without the batch dimension; in our case, dimensionality of the embeddings) and `num_classes` (number of output classes). The call to `super().__init__()` within this method is essential as it initializes the parent class, which implements most of the functionality of our model. A linear layer is created using `torch.nn.Linear` which applies a linear transformation to the incoming data. This linear layer is essentially a matrix of weights that gets multiplied with the inputs, followed by the addition of a bias term, all of them registered as parameters of the model whose values will be updated during training. The linear model assumes a first dimension corresponding to the batch size, so the input features are expected to be of size `(batch_size, input_size)`. The output of the linear layer will be of size `(batch_size, num_classes)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `forward` method outlines the forward pass of the neural network. Here, the output of the linear layer is passed through the `torch.nn.functional.log_softmax` function. This function applies a softmax activation followed by a logarithm, producing the logarithmic probabilities of the classes. The `dim=1` argument in `log_softmax` specifies that the softmax should be applied across the columns (moving from the first to the last column), calculating a different softmax for each row in the batch. The `log_softmax` function is used instead of the `softmax` function because it is numerically more stable. Remember the fundamental concepts here: the constructor defines the layers and parameters of the model, and the forward function defines how the input is transformed into the output.\n",

The `optimizer` object of class `torch.optim.SGD` implements the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which is used to update the model parameters during training based on the gradient of the loss function. The function `torch.nn.Module.parameters` inherited by our model class returns an iterator over the model parameters (weights and bias of the linear layer in our case).

        "In PyTorch, `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, `torch.nn.BCELoss`, and `torch.nn.NLLLoss` are loss functions used in different classification contexts, each with specific requirements for their input types. `CrossEntropyLoss` is widely used for multi-class classification tasks and is designed to take *logits* (the raw, unnormalized scores outputted by the final layer of the network) as its inputs. Conveniently, `CrossEntropyLoss` does not require the target labels to be one-hot encoded, and expects them to be represented as class indices, which is usually how we will have them. Internally, this function applies the softmax function to the logits and then computes the log loss. In binary classification scenarios, `BCELoss` (binary cross-entropy loss) is the go-to choice. This function expects the outputs of your model to be probabilities; the target labels for `BCELoss` should be in the same format as the model outputs, i.e., probabilities, not indices. Finally, `NLLLoss` (negative log likelihood loss) is used in multiclass classification tasks, but expects log-probabilities in the output, which requires applying a `log_softmax` function to your model's final layer outputs. The target labels for `NLLLoss` should also be class indices, not one-hot encoded vectors. In summary, `CrossEntropyLoss` and `NLLLoss` are used for multi-class classification and expect class indices as targets, while `BCELoss` is for binary classification and expects probabilities.\n",

        "The function `torch.save` saves the model parameters to a file. The function `torch.load` loads the model parameters from a file. The file extension is usually `.pt` or `.pth`. There are two possibilities for model saving depending on whether we want to continue training the model or not. During training, a large amount of information beyond the model parameters may be stored by, for example, the optimizer. If we want to continue training the model from the current point, all these must be saved too with `torch.save(model, path)`. If we just want to redistribute the model for inference, we can save only the model parameters with `model.state_dict` as in the following code. The state dictionary of a model is a Python dictionary object that maps each layer to its parameter tensor. \n",
