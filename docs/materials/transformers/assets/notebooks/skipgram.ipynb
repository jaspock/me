        "Notebook and code written by Juan Antonio Pérez in 2024. Originally inspired by the Tae Hwan Jung's code (@graykode) at the [NLP tutorial](https://github.com/graykode/nlp-tutorial).\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook presents the implementation of a skip-gram model to obtain non-contextual word embeddings. It is assumed that you are already familiar with the basics of PyTorch, but at a absolute beginner level only. This notebook complements a [learning guide](https://dlsi.ua.es/~japerez/materials/transformers/intro/) based on studying the math behind the models by reading the book \"[Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)\" (3rd edition) by Jurafsky and Martin. It is part of a series of notebooks which are supposed to be incrementally studied, so make sure you follow the right order. If your learning is being supervised by a teacher, follow the additional instructions that you may have received. Although you may use a GPU environment to execute the code, the computational requirements for the default settings are so low that you can probably run it on CPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "The conceptual framework that we need to implement this model is so similar to the one used in the notebooks implementing logistic and softmax regressors that most of your effort will be spent in understanding the process of obtaining the data or representing the embeddings, more than in PyTorch code itself. As you will see, the skip-gram model is a particular case of a logistic regressor where the output is interpreted as the probability of a word being a *context word* of another word, that is, the probability of two words being close neighbors in a text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our softmax regressor dealing with topic classification required each input sentence to be encoded as an embedding vector. As it was too early to talk about embeddings, we used a library (`sentence-transformers`) to obtain them in a black-box fashion. Here we will see how to get an embedding for every word in a text, not for every sentence. However, it turns out that, although there exist more elaborated methods to obtain sentence embeddings, one the simplest ones is to average the embeddings of the words in the sentence. Consequently, this notebook could also be easily adapted to implement a very rudimentary version of the `sentence-transformers` library by first obtaining the embeddings of the words in a sentence and then averaging them to obtain the embedding of a particular sentence."

        "\n",
        "We start with the code that obtains the data that will be later packed into mini-batches. Following the algorithm, each mini-batch contains positive and negative samples in a 1:$k$ ratio. To obtain the positive samples, we iterate over the corpus word by word. For each *target* word, we obtain the context words within a window of size $L$. As allowing different values of $L$ would slightly complicate the implementation, we simply set $L=1$ and consider only the *context* words before and after the target word. To obtain the negative samples, we combine the target word with sampled noise words from the vocabulary. The Jurafsky and Martin's book explains that these noise words are chosen based on their unigram frequency, but we will also simplify here and choose them uniformly at random.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Corpus\n",
        "\n",
        "We usually use a large text file to train a skip-gram model. For the sake of simplicity, we use a toy dataset stored in a single string in which each sentence contains a few words belonging to one of a few noticeable domains, namely, fruits, animals, colors and musical instruments. Sometimes, a word of one of the domains occurs in the context of a sentence of the other domain to illustrate the fact that language is ambiguous and that the same word can have different meanings depending on the context. \n",
        "\n",
        "Observe how the corpus is already tokenized so that the period at the end of each sentence is considered as a word. Separating the period from the last word of the sentence, we make sure that \"uva\" and \"uva.\" are not considered as different words. We also lowercase all the words to avoid having different embeddings for the same word in different cases (\"Manzana\" and \"manzana\", for example). Although this preprocessing was frequent in the past, it is not common anymore in current real-world applications due to the large scale of the datasets and training procedures. As real-life applications do not process only words (see the period here, for example), the more general term *token* will be used to refer to the atomic elements of the vocabulary. When using modern tokenizers such as BPE or SentencePiece, tokens can be words, but also subwords, characters, punctuation marks, emojis, or even the bytes which make up the different characters."

Both are instances of PyTorch's `nn.Embedding` class, which is used to store word embeddings. The `nn.Embedding` layer is a lookup table that maps the index of a word to its embedding vector. The embedding vectors are the parameters of the layer and are updated during training. The `nn.Embedding` layer is a particular case of the `nn.Linear` layer, which we have already used. As most of the functions in PyTorch, `nn.Embedding` expects a mini-batch of word indices as input and not a single word index. It then returns a mini-batch of embedding vectors. The `voc_size` parameter specifies the size of the vocabulary, whereas the `embedding_size` parameter sets the dimensionality of each embedding vector. In essence, `self.W` serves as the embedding matrix for target words, while `self.C` is for context/noise words in the training data.\n",

The method uses the embedding layer to transform these input word indices into dense embedding vectors.\n",

This function is a powerful tool that allows for concise and efficient computation of complex tensor algebra.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's consider the case where we have a mini-batch of target words represented by their embeddings $\\mathbf{w}_1,\\mathbf{w}_2,\\ldots,\\mathbf{w}_E$. For each of these target words, we have an associated contextual word embedding $\\mathbf{c}_1,\\mathbf{c}_2,\\ldots,\\mathbf{c}_E$. To simplify, let's not consider negative samples, but this analysis is fully extendable to the case where they are included.\n",

We want to calculate the dot product of each $\\mathbf{w}_i$ with its corresponding $\\mathbf{c}_i$, a calculation fundamental in the training and use of skip-gram models as you already know. To obtain these dot products using PyTorch and benefit from the efficiency of tensor operations computed on GPUs, we can pack the embeddings of the target words by rows into a matrix $A$ of size $E \\times N$ and the embeddings of the contextual words by columns into a matrix $B$ of size $N \\times E$. By calculating the product $A \\cdot B$, we will obtain a matrix of size $E \\times E$ where each element $i,j$ is the dot product of $\\mathbf{w}_i$ with $\\mathbf{c}_j$. \n",

Specifically, those that form part of the diagonal of the result, which will be the ones of the form $\\mathbf{w}_i$ $\\mathbf{c}_i$. Matrix multiplication is very inefficient in this case for our purposes, but if we look in the PyTorch documentation, we will not find an operation that fits exactly to our interests in a first reading.\n",

Here, we use the `Adam` optimizer (an extension of stochastic gradient descent) and the `BCELoss` (binary cross-entropy) loss function. The main novelty is that the lists of indices returned by `random_batch` are converted into PyTorch tensors of long integers (`torch.long`) before being passed to the model. This is because PyTorch expects the indices of the embedding layer to be of this type. Note, however, that `BCELoss` expects the labels to be floating-point numbers (`torch.float32`). The remaining code is very similar to what we have seen before.\n",
