        "This notebook presents the implementation of a skip-gram model to obtain non-contextual word embeddings       . The conceptual framework that we need to implement this model is so similar to the one used in the notebooks implementing logistic and softmax regressors that most of your effort will be spent in understanding the process of obtaining the data or representing the embeddings, more than in PyTorch code itself. As you will see, the skip-gram model is a particular case of a logistic regressor where the output is the probability of a word being a context word of another word, that is, the probability of two words being close neighbors in a text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our softmax regressor dealing with topic classification required each input sentence to be encoded as an embedding vector. As it was too early to talk about embeddings, we used a library (`sentence-transformers`) to obtain them in a black-box fashion. Here we will see how to get an embedding for every word in a text, not for every sentence. However, it turns out that, although there exist more elaborated methods to obtain sentence embeddings, one the simplest ones is to average the embeddings of the words in the sentence. Consequently, this notebook could also be easily adapted to implement a very rudimentary version of the `sentence-transformers` library.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question**: Integrate this code and the code of the softmax regressor to have a self-contained version of the sentence topic classifier that does not depend on external libraries."

        "We start with the code that obtains the data that will be later packed into mini-batches. Following the algorithm, each mini-batch contains positive and negative samples in a 1:$k$ ratio. To obatin the positive samples, we iterate over the corpus word by word. For each *target* word, we obtain the context words within a window of size $L$. As allowing different values of $L$ would slightly complicate the implementation, we simply set $L=1$ and consider only the *context* words before and after the target word. To obtain the negative samples, we combine the target word and sample noise words from the vocabulary. The Martin and Jurafsky's book explains that these noise words are chosen based on their unigram frequency, but we will also simplify here and choose them uniformly at random.\n",
        "\n",
        "We usually use a large text file to train the skip-gram model. For the sake of simplicity, we use a toy dataset stored in a single string in which each sentence contains a few words and two noticeable domains, namely, fruits and animals, can be found. Sometimes, a word of one of the domains occurs in the context of a sentence of the other domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Observe how the period at the end of each sentence is considered as a word. Separating the period from the last word of the sentence, we make sure that \"uva\" and \"uva.\" are not considered as different words. We also lowercase all the words to avoid having different embeddings for the same word in different cases (\"Manzana\" and \"manzana\", for example). Although this preprocessing was frequent in the past, it is not common anymore in current real-world applications due to the large scale of the datasets and training procedures. This is a first example of how we will not process only words; actually, the more general word *token* will be used to refer to the atomic elements of the vocabulary. As we will see, tokens can be words, but also subwords, characters, punctuation marks, emojis, or even the bytes which make up the different characters."

        "\n",
        "We have already implemented some PyTorch models by now, so you should be familiar with the basic ideas of the following code. There are, however, some new additions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `Word2Vec` class extends PyTorch's `nn.Module`. The constructor method `__init__` is responsible for initializing the model's layers and other components. In this class, two embedding layers are created and randomly initialized: `self.W` and `self.C`. Both are instances of PyTorch's `nn.Embedding` class, which is used to store word embeddings. The `nn.Embedding` layer is a lookup table that maps the index of a word to its embedding vector. The embedding vectors are the parameters of the layer and are updated during training. The `nn.Embedding` layer is a particular case of the `nn.Linear` layer, which we have already used. As most of the functions in PyTorch, `nn.Embedding` expects a mini-batch of word indices as input and not a single word index. It then returns a mini-batch of embedding vectors. The `voc_size` parameter specifies the size of the vocabulary, whereas the `embedding_size` parameter sets the size of each embedding vector. In essence, `self.W` serves as the embedding matrix for target words, while `self.C` is for context words in the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `forward` method defines the computation performed at every call of the model. It takes two arguments, `Xt` and `Xc`, which are the input tensors for target words and context/noise words, both of size `(batch_size, 1)`. The method uses the embedding layers to transform these input word indices into dense embedding vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Einstein summation notation\n",
        "\n",
        "The most critical operation is `torch.einsum` which we describe next. You may find from time to time that some operations that you would like to perform are not available in PyTorch. In these cases, you can use `torch.einsum` to perform tensor operations with Einstein summation notation. This function is a powerful tool that allows for concise and efficient computation of complex tensor algebra.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's consider the case where we have a mini-batch of target words represented by their embeddings $\\mathbf{w}_1,\\mathbf{w}_2,\\ldots,\\mathbf{w}_E$. For each of these target words, we have an associated contextual word in the set $\\mathbf{c}_1,\\mathbf{c}_2,\\ldots,\\mathbf{c}_E$. To simplify, let's not consider negative samples, but this analysis is fully extendable to the case where they are included.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let $N$ be the size of the embeddings. We want to calculate the dot product of each $\\mathbf{w}_i$ with its corresponding $\\mathbf{c}_i$, a calculation fundamental in the training and use of skip-gram models. To obtain these dot products using PyTorch and benefit from the efficiency of matrix operations computed on GPUs, we can pack the embeddings of the target words by rows into a matrix $A$ of size $E \\times N$ and the embeddings of the contextual words by columns into a matrix $B$ of size $N \\times E$. By calculating the product $A \\cdot B$, we will obtain a matrix of size $E \\times E$ where each element $i,j$ is the dot product of $\\mathbf{w}_i$ with $\\mathbf{c}_j$. \n",
        "\n",
        "However, we are only interested in a small part of all these dot products. Specifically, those that form part of the diagonal of the result, which will be the ones of the form $\\mathbf{w}_i$ $\\mathbf{c}_i$. Matrix multiplication is very inefficient in this case for our purposes, but if we look in the PyTorch documentation, we will not initially find an operation that fits exactly to our interests.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is, however, in PyTorch an efficient and compact way to define matrix operations based on Einstein's notation, which you can learn a little about by reading up to approximately section 2.8 of the tutorial \"[Einsum is all you need](https://rockt.github.io/2018/04/30/einsum)\". In particular, we can see that we are interested in obtaining a vector $\\mathbf{d}$ such that:\n",

The main novelty is that the lists of indices returned by `random_batch` are converted into PyTorch tensors of long integers (`torch.long`) before being passed to the model. This is because PyTorch expects the indices of the embedding layer to be of this type. Note, however, that `BCELoss` expects the labels to be floating-point numbers (`torch.float32`).
